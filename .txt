Instead of using try-catch in every file we have make a different error file we just need to give status and the message for that status

 /* Step of alorithum (Steps of our work process)
    --  Get user details from frontend
    --  Validation - should not be empty
    --  Check if user already exists: by username, email
    --  Check for images, check for avatar
    --  Upload them to cloudinary, avatar
    --  Create user object - create entry in db
    --  Remove password and refresh token field from response
    --  Check for user creation
    --  Return response      */


          Get new access token by Refresh Token 
 -- we need to remember that first you need to send refresh token in request.body in Postman.      
 -- And you get refreshed open by passing login request in request body. 
 -- After passing request we need to check VScode terminalfro refresh token.
 -- After getting refresh token we write Refresh token in request.body in postman for new access token which we see in res.body.
